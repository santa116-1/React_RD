# Pre-workshop Reading.

We're still working on this section, but we do have a few things for you to read if you want:

- Learning React does have a few [pre-requisites](/prerequisites.md). We realize not everyone attending our workshops is a full-time front-end developer. But we have to assume that attendees are caught up on some of these "common knowledge" font-end things.
- We have a [glossary of terms](/glossary.md) that might help you as well.
- React requires you to understand modern JavaScript. A lot has changed in JS in the last few years. Brush up on the most common syntax by reading our [JavaScript Primer](https://reacttraining.com/blog/javascript-the-react-parts/) for React.

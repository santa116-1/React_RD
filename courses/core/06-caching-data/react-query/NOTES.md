# React Query

Start in `BrowseCourses` and show the migration of code that was our custom context caching solution into React Query and then into a React Query custom hook.

Be sure to show the `index.tsx` file and how we're using a provider from React Query

Discuss three ways to keep our cache current after we remove a course:

1. Refetch
2. Mutate
3. Mutate with React Query's mutation handler

We can also show how `BrowseCourseLessons` and `PreviousNextCourse` are also updated to use ReactQuery now as well

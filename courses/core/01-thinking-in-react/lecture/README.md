# Notes for Instructor

We like React because:

1. It's declarative
2. It's composable

Main topics to explain

- `React.createElement`
- JSX (Babel compiles)
- Definition of a component
- Invoking components with JSX (elements)
- Element vs Component
- Props
- className not class - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className

Remember, if you make any `<button>` elements, add a `className="button"` since that what our design system needs

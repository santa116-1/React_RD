# Data Fetching with useEffect

## Review the component hierarchy

```
Board
â”œâ”€â”€> TaskGroup
     â”œâ”€â”€> TaskDialog   <-- Work on this file
     â”œâ”€â”€> TaskCard     <-- Work on this file
```

- Board implements numerous TaskGroups (Which represent a column in the UI)
- Each TaskGroup implements the TaskCards which are the white boxes in the UI
- When a TaskCard is clicked, TaskGroup gets the respective `taskId` and opens the TaskDialog for that task
- The Reason why TaskDialog is at this level instead of inside the TaskCard is so we can have one task open in the Dialog and easily change to another task. This is done by having an array of all sibling tasks in the TaskGroup given to the TaskDialog

## âœ… Task 1: TaskCard Data

1. Open TaskCard.tsx. In the browser, navigate to a board that has tasks.
2. Write an effect to get the task based on the `taskId` prop. Hint, the effect is identical to the code in TaskDialog if you want to peak ðŸ‘€.
3. When the page loads, you should be able to see the Task Cards load with their data now.

## âœ… Task 2: Custom Hook

4. Since we now have the same useEffect logic twice, refactor `TaskCard` and `TaskDialog` to use the existing `useTask.ts` custom hook.

Remember, the main reason for custom hooks is code-reuse.

# State

Remember, the only fines you'll ever work on will have corresponding `.final` files. These `.final` files are for you to review while your coding. They are the solution and it's okay to look. ðŸ™‚

## âœ… Task 1: Create State for Progress Slider

1. Open `Task.js`. There are also some inline comments for instructions in that file.
2. Make `completedMinutes` stateful with the `useState` hook.
3. When the progress slider is changed by the user, the function passed into it's `onChange` prop will be called. Use that to set your newly created state.

## âœ… Task 2: Create State for Progress Slider

4. Currently, the `Minutes.js` file already has state. Remove the state from the `Minutes` component and move it up into the `Task` component. This is called "lifting state".
5. Pass down `minutes` and `setMinutes` (the variables created from `useState`) as props into `Minutes` like this:

```jsx
<Minutes minutes={minutes} setMinutes={setMinutes} />
```

6. Remember you need to adjust the Minutes component to receive those props as arguments.
7. Implement the `onClick` for the "Complete" button so it will set the `completedMinutes` to equal the `minutes` value.

## Check Your Work

At this point, you should be able to use the UI to adjust minutes and the progress to see your results.

## âœ… BONUS TASK!

8. Adjust the color of the button and the progress bar to be green if the task is "complete" based on whether `minutes` and `completedMinutes` are the same. Notice there are two color values at the top of the file. Giving a color to the progress is just a prop, but for the button you'll need to add an additional class of `button-green`.
9. You might notice that if you decrease `minutes` to be less than `completedMinutes`, the UI will let you. This probably doesn't make sense to allow the user to do this. Let's ensure that `minutes` cannot be less than `completedMinutes` by passing a `minMinutes` prop into `Minutes` like this:

```jsx
<Minutes minutes={minutes} min={currentMinutes} setMinutes={setMinutes} />
```

If you open the `Minutes` component you'll already notice that the subtract function doesn't allow us to go below 0. Adjust the code so now it can't go below the `min` prop being passed in.

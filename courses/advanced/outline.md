The advanced curriculum is approxamently one day's worth of material and teaches

- Advanced scenarios with context

- Advanced non-DOM related scenarios for `useRef`

# Prerequisites

For taking our Advanced Workshop, attendees should:

- be very comfortable with JSX and key concepts like props and state.
- be comfortable with making components from scratch.
- be comfortable with basic hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- have some exposure to `useReducer` and the reducer pattern.
- have some exposure to React's context API.

In the very first lesson, before any lecture is given, we ask the attendee to build a component based on their existing React knowledge given a set of specifications. We assume you know how to do this given the list of prerequisites form above in order to be successful in our Advanced Workshop.

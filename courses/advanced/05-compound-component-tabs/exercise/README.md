# Compound Component Tabs

✅ It renders, but it doesn't work yet.

## Task One:

❌ Get some state working with context. Use `activeIndex`
❌ Each `Tab` will be unaware if it's index unless you do a `React.Children.map` on the parent `TabList` (similar to what the instructor encountered with `Accordion`).
❌ Add ARIA role for: tablist, tab, and tabpanel appropriately.
❌ Add aria-selected="true" (or false) for each tab.

## Task Two:

❌ Implement an `onChange` with the `Tabs` component.
❌ Implement an onClick with the `Tab` component. Be sure to wrap with `wrapEvent`.

## Task Three:

❌ Implement an `index` prop to `Tabs` which can be used to control the tabs from the owner.

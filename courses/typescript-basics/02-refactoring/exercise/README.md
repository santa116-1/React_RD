# Refactoring

For this exercise, refactor the calculator app in `index.js` to TypeScript.

Start by renaming the file with a `.ts` file extension. You should see a few errors in your editor at this point, so figuring out and fixing those is a good place to start!

Because untyped values are implicitly typed as `any`, you don't technically _need_ to add type annotations to every value. But for increased safety, it's generally a good idea to avoid the `any` type. Add types wherever possible to catch more potential bugs, and make note of whichever types you're unsure about so we can add them later.

Remember, refactoring doesn't mean that everything _has_ to be strongly typed. The beauty of TypeScript is its flexibility, so we want to be practical and add as much type information as we can. We have deadlines, after all!

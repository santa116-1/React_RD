# Classes

This exercise is a chance to express your creativity!

We want to build a few classes from scratch. What these look like is ultimately up to you, but we want to create the basic workings of User classes for a new blogging platform we're building.

Our blogging app will have a base user, but we'll also have different types of users depending on their permissions:
- Registered user
  - This user registered for the app but is awaiting approval before they can do anything
- Approved user
  - Once an admin approves the user, they should be able to create new posts, as well as modify or delete any posts they create
- Admin
  - An admin can create or modify their own posts or any other posts in the app. They can also remove, add and approve users.

This is a fake app, so of course we don't need to actually implement any of the functionality of these classes. We are simply modeling the data and expressing the types we'll need for each class and its methods. You'll be surprised how far this gets you when you replicate this in a real app!

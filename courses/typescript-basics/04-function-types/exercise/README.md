# Function Types

In `index.ts` there are a number of (likely familiar) utility functions.

We need to add types to each function's parameters, as well as the return type.

Remember that functions can be flexible! Some (or all) parameters may be optional, or they may be expressed as different types. Use generics or overloads to capture that flexibility as best you can.
